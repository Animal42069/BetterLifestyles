# BetterLifestyles

This is a simple plugin that makes the character lifestyles actually do something in AIS.  I have done extensive testing with lifestyles, and I've come to the conclusion that other than flavor text, they don't actually do anything.  With this plugin, once a character acquires a lifestyle, they will actually dedicate more time to performing actions associated with that lifestyle.<br>

The way it works, is normally when an action is perfomed, the desire to do that action again gets set to 0.  They won't perform that action again until the desire accumulates to a certain value.  With this plugin, if the action is one of their lifestyle actions, then it will get reset to 30 instead of 0, and so their desire to do it again will occur much sooner.<br>
